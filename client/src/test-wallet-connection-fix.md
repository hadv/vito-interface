# Wallet Connection Fix Test

## Issue Description
When users connect their wallet to Safe wallet via WalletConnect, the app was incorrectly displaying these connections as dApp connections instead of recognizing them as signer wallet connections. **This issue was particularly noticeable when stopping and restarting the app.**

## Root Cause
**On app restart**: `DAppWalletConnectService.loadExistingSessions()` was loading ALL WalletConnect sessions from storage, including signer wallet sessions, causing them to appear as dApp connections.

## Fix Applied

### Simple Solution: Don't Load Existing Sessions
- Updated `loadExistingSessions()` to not load any existing sessions on app restart
- This prevents signer wallet sessions from being incorrectly loaded as dApp connections
- dApp connections will be re-established when users explicitly connect via pairing codes

## Files Modified
1. `client/src/services/DAppWalletConnectService.ts`
   - **Updated `loadExistingSessions()` to not load any existing sessions on app restart**

## Testing Steps

### Before Fix (Expected Issue):
1. Connect Safe wallet in read-only mode
2. Connect signer wallet via WalletConnect QR code
3. **Stop and restart the app**
4. Check dApp connections modal - would show the signer wallet as a dApp connection

### After Fix (Expected Behavior):
1. Connect Safe wallet in read-only mode
2. Connect signer wallet via WalletConnect QR code
3. **Stop and restart the app**
4. Signer wallet should appear in header as connected signer
5. dApp connections modal should remain empty (clean state)
6. Users can connect dApps explicitly via pairing codes when needed

## Verification
- Signer wallet connections should only appear in the header wallet dropdown
- dApp connections modal starts empty on app restart
- dApp connections can be established explicitly via pairing codes
