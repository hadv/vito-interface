# WalletConnect Timeout Fix

## Issue Summary
Fixed the critical bug where WalletConnect connections would hang indefinitely when Phantom browser extension interfered with MetaMask connections, as described in [Issue #39](https://github.com/hadv/vito-interface/issues/39).

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurred because:
1. The `connectResult.approval()` call in WalletConnect had no timeout mechanism
2. When Phantom extension interfered with MetaMask, this call would hang indefinitely
3. The `isConnecting` flag remained true, preventing retry attempts
4. No user-facing way to cancel or reset the connection state

## Solution Overview
Implemented a comprehensive timeout and cancellation system with the following components:

### 1. Connection Timeout Mechanism
- Added configurable timeout (default: 60 seconds) to `WalletConnectService.initialize()`
- Implemented `Promise.race()` between approval and timeout promises
- Automatic state cleanup on timeout

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Specific timeout error messages mentioning extension interference
- Differentiated error events (`session_timeout` vs `session_error`)
- User-friendly troubleshooting guidance

### 3. Improved UI/UX
- Real-time countdown display during connection attempts
- Cancel button to abort pending connections
- Extension interference detection and warnings
- Retry functionality with proper state reset

### 4. Connection State Management
- Proper cleanup of connecting state on timeout/cancellation
- Prevention of duplicate connection attempts
- Bidirectional cancellation support

## Files Modified

### Core Service Changes
- **`client/src/services/WalletConnectService.ts`**
  - Added timeout parameter to `initialize()` method
  - Implemented timeout logic with `Promise.race()`
  - Enhanced error handling and event emission
  - Added connection cancellation methods

### UI Component Updates
- **`client/src/components/ui/WalletConnectModal.tsx`**
  - Added timeout countdown display
  - Implemented cancel button functionality
  - Enhanced error messaging with troubleshooting tips
  - Extension interference detection and warnings

### Test Coverage
- **`client/src/tests/walletconnect-timeout.test.ts`** - Unit tests
- **`client/src/tests/integration/walletconnect-timeout-integration.test.ts`** - Integration tests

## Key Features

### 1. Timeout Configuration
```typescript
// Default 60-second timeout
await walletConnectService.initialize(chainId, forceNew, 60000);

// Custom timeout
await walletConnectService.initialize(chainId, forceNew, 30000);
```

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
```typescript
// Listen for timeout events
walletConnectService.addEventListener('session_timeout', (data) => {
  console.log('Connection timed out:', data.error.message);
  console.log('Timeout duration:', data.timeoutMs);
});

// Listen for cancellation events
walletConnectService.addEventListener('session_cancelled', (data) => {
  console.log('Connection cancelled:', data.reason);
});
```

### 3. User Interface Improvements
- **Countdown Timer**: Shows remaining time during connection
- **Cancel Button**: Allows users to abort hanging connections
- **Extension Warning**: Alerts users about potential conflicts
- **Troubleshooting Tips**: Provides actionable guidance for common issues

### 4. Extension Interference Detection
```typescript
// Detects multiple wallet extensions
if (window.phantom?.solana && window.ethereum?.isMetaMask) {
  // Show warning about potential conflicts
}
```

## Error Messages

### Timeout Error
```
WalletConnect connection timeout after 60 seconds. This may be caused by wallet extension interference (e.g., Phantom blocking MetaMask). Please try again or disable conflicting extensions.
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Disable conflicting wallet extensions
- Ensure mobile wallet app is open and ready
- Check internet connection
- Try refreshing the page

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=walletconnect-timeout.test.ts
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=walletconnect-timeout-integration.test.ts
```

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Normal Connection**: Verify timeout doesn't interfere with successful connections
2. **Extension Interference**: Test with both MetaMask and Phantom installed
3. **Timeout Handling**: Wait for timeout and verify proper error handling
4. **Cancellation**: Test cancel button functionality
5. **Retry Logic**: Verify retry works after timeout/cancellation

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome with MetaMask extension
- Chrome with Phantom extension
- Chrome with both MetaMask and Phantom extensions
- Firefox with wallet extensions
- Safari with wallet extensions

## Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead: Only adds timeout promise and event listeners
- No impact on successful connections
- Improved user experience during failed connections

## Future Enhancements
1. **Adaptive Timeout**: Adjust timeout based on network conditions
2. **Extension Management**: Automatic detection and guidance for extension conflicts
3. **Connection Analytics**: Track timeout patterns for optimization
4. **Progressive Retry**: Implement exponential backoff for retries

## Deployment Notes
- No breaking changes to existing API
- Backward compatible with existing timeout-less calls
- Default timeout of 60 seconds provides good balance between user experience and connection reliability
- All existing functionality preserved

## Monitoring
Monitor the following metrics post-deployment:
- Connection timeout frequency
- User cancellation rates
- Retry success rates
- Extension interference incidents

This fix completely resolves the hanging connection issue while providing a much better user experience for wallet connection scenarios.
