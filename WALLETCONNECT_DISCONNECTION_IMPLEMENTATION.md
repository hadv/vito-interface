# WalletConnect Bidirectional Disconnection Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides proper bidirectional disconnection handling for WalletConnect integration, ensuring that:

1. **When a user disconnects from their mobile wallet**, the web app automatically detects this and updates its state
2. **When a user disconnects from the web app**, the mobile wallet session is also properly terminated

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced WalletConnectionService

**File**: `client/src/services/WalletConnectionService.ts`

- **Added WalletConnect event listeners** in the constructor to listen for session events
- **Enhanced `disconnectSignerWallet()`** to also disconnect WalletConnect session when wallet type is WalletConnect
- **Enhanced `disconnectWallet()`** to handle complete disconnection including WalletConnect
- **Added `setupWalletConnectEventListeners()`** method to handle mobile wallet disconnection events
- **Added `handleWalletConnectDisconnection()`** method to update app state when mobile wallet disconnects
- **Added `cleanup()`** method for proper resource cleanup

**Key Features**:
- Listens to `session_disconnected`, `session_delete`, and `session_expire` events from WalletConnectService
- Only processes events when currently connected via WalletConnect (prevents interference with other wallet types)
- Maintains Safe wallet in read-only mode when signer is disconnected
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Enhanced WalletConnectService

**File**: `client/src/services/WalletConnectService.ts`

- **Enhanced session event handling** to emit `session_disconnected` events for both deletion and expiry
- **Added `getSessionTopic()`** method to expose current session topic
- **Added `isSessionValid()`** method to check if a session is still valid

**Key Features**:
- Emits consistent `session_disconnected` events for easier handling
- Provides session validation capabilities
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. Enhanced UI Feedback

**File**: `client/src/components/ui/Header.tsx`

- **Added automatic notification** when mobile wallet disconnects
- **Enhanced state change detection** to differentiate between app-initiated and mobile-initiated disconnections

**Key Features**:
- Shows user-friendly notification when mobile wallet disconnects
- Maintains UI consistency during disconnection events
- Provides clear feedback about current connection state

## How It Works

### Mobile Wallet Disconnection Flow

1. **User disconnects from mobile wallet** (e.g., closes app, manually disconnects)
2. **WalletConnect SignClient** receives `session_delete` or `session_expire` event
3. **WalletConnectService** emits `session_disconnected` event
4. **WalletConnectionService** receives the event and calls `handleWalletConnectDisconnection()`
5. **App state is updated** to read-only mode (Safe wallet remains connected, signer is removed)
6. **UI is notified** and shows disconnection message to user
7. **User can continue** viewing Safe wallet in read-only mode or reconnect a signer

### App-Initiated Disconnection Flow

1. **User clicks disconnect** in the web app
2. **WalletConnectionService.disconnectSignerWallet()** is called
3. **WalletConnect session is disconnected** via `walletConnectService.disconnect()`
4. **Mobile wallet receives disconnection** and updates its state
5. **Local app state is cleared** and updated to read-only mode
6. **UI is updated** to reflect disconnected state

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Connect via WalletConnect**:
   - Connect your Safe wallet in read-only mode
   - Connect a signer via WalletConnect
   - Verify both connections are working

2. **Test Mobile Wallet Disconnection**:
   - On your mobile wallet, manually disconnect or close the app
   - Verify the web app shows a notification about disconnection
   - Verify the web app switches to read-only mode
   - Verify you can still view Safe wallet data

3. **Test App-Initiated Disconnection**:
   - Click the disconnect button in the web app
   - Verify the mobile wallet shows disconnection
   - Verify the web app switches to read-only mode

### Automated Testing

A test script is provided at `client/src/test-walletconnect-disconnection.ts`:

```javascript
// In browser console after connecting WalletConnect:

// Run all tests
testWalletConnectDisconnection.runAll();

// Test individual scenarios
testWalletConnectDisconnection.testMobile();    // Test mobile disconnection
testWalletConnectDisconnection.testApp();       // Test app disconnection
testWalletConnectDisconnection.testValidation(); // Test session validation
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Network failures** during disconnection don't prevent local state cleanup
- **Invalid sessions** are detected and handled gracefully
- **Event listener failures** are logged but don't crash the app
- **Timeout scenarios** are handled with appropriate fallbacks

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users get clear feedback when disconnection occurs
2. **Consistent State**: App state always reflects actual connection status
3. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling ensures app stability
5. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps with troubleshooting

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The implementation uses existing WalletConnect and wallet connection services.

## Compatibility

This implementation is compatible with:
- WalletConnect v2
- All existing wallet connection flows
- MetaMask and other wallet integrations (no interference)
- Safe wallet read-only mode

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Reconnection prompts** when session expires
2. **Session persistence** across browser refreshes
3. **Multiple session management** for advanced use cases
4. **Custom disconnection reasons** for better user messaging
